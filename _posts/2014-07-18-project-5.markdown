description: This was for my sonâ€™s 4th birthday. He wanted something big and loves Spiderman, so I made a life size Spiderman head. I had a 6 week old newborn, so I used a polystyrene head to achieve the effect with a chocolate sponge and chocolate buttercream body. The whole thing was covered in fondant with the webs painted on.
